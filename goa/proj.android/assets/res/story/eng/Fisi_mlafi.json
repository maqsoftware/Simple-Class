  "1":"Atabo and Akiru went to the river to collect water. \n",
  "2":"On their way back home they rested on some rocks. \n",
  "3":"Atabo tried to stand up to continue home. But she was stuck to the rock. \nAkiru ran home to call mother. \n",
  "4":"When mother arrived at the rock, she found Atabo truly stuck. \n",
  "5":"\"I will make a fence around the rock to protect you from wild animals,\" mother said to Atabo. \n",
  "6":"So, she made a fence. And she made one door for her to get inside. \n",
  "7":"Then mother said to Atabo, \"I will bring you food. When I come I will sing a song for you to open the door.\"\nThis is what she sang, \"lka kook nachirima. Bala ekena, ke...ke...i...ya.Tangarae totokonia kainak ngakon kile.\"\nMother also said, \"Never open the door to a stranger.\" Whenever she came she sang the song. Atabo would open the door and receive the food. \n",
  "8":"Hyena was hiding and listening. He watched when mother came to feed Atabo. \n",
  "9":"Hyena tried to copy mother's song. He practised and practised. \n",
  "10":"The other animals told Hyena to swallow a fly from the river so that he could sing better. \nHe swallowed a fly from the river and went to sing. But the door did not open. \n",
  "11":"Next, he swallowed a fly from the nearby plains and he went to sing. But the door did not open. \nFinally he swallowed a fly from the far away plains. \n",
  "12":"With this new voice he again went to sing at the door. \nThe door opened, and Hyena ate Atabo. \n",
  "13":"When mother came again, she sang, and sang, and sang. But nothing happened. \nSo she called a meeting of all the animals and lit a large fire. \"The animal that ate Atabo will fall into the fire and burn,\" she said. \n",
  "14":"All the animals jumped safely over the fire. Only Fox and Hyena remained. \n",
  "15":"Fox jumped and the fire caught his tail. He cried in pain. \nLast of all came the hyena. He jumped and fell into the fire. \n",
  "16":"Then all the animals sang, \"Ata kalio. Anikanyamit ikon koku. Achakakin nakim na, chi...gi...gir.\"\n",
